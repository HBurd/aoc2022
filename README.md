Advent of Code 2022
===================

I will attempt to use a different language every day.
`languages.txt` contains an arbitrary list of languages that I'm allowed to use.

| Day | Language     |
| --- | ------------ |
|  1  | C++          |
|  2  | Rust         |
|  3  | x86 Assembly |
|  4  | Standard ML  |
